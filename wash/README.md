## Why wash

`wash` is a bundle of command line tools that, together, form a comprehensive CLI for [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.dev) development. Everything from generating new wasmCloud projects, managing cryptographic signing keys, and interacting with OCI compliant registries is contained within the subcommands of `wash`. Our goal with `wash` is to encapsulate our tools into a single binary to make developing WebAssembly with wasmCloud painless and simple.

## Installing wash

### Cargo

```
cargo install wash-cli
```

### Linux (deb/rpm + apt)

```
# Debian / Ubuntu (deb)
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
# Fedora (rpm)
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash

sudo apt install wasmcloud wash
```

### Linux (snap)

```
sudo snap install wash --edge --devmode
```

### MacOS (brew)

```
brew tap wasmcloud/wasmcloud
brew install wasmcloud wash
```

### Windows (choco)

```powershell
choco install wash
```

### Nix

```
nix run github:wasmCloud/wash
```

## Using wash

`wash` has multiple subcommands, each specializing in one specific area of the wasmCloud development process.

### call

Invoke a wasmCloud actor directly with a specified payload. This allows you to test actor handlers without the need to manage capabilities and link definitions for a rapid development feedback loop.

### claims

Generate JWTs for actors, capability providers, accounts and operators. Sign actor modules with claims including capability IDs, expiration, and keys to verify identity. Inspect actor modules to view their claims.

### ctl

Interact directly with a wasmCloud [control-interface](https://github.com/wasmCloud/control-interface), allowing you to imperatively schedule actors, providers and modify configurations of a wasmCloud host. Can be used to interact with local and remote control-interfaces.

### ctx

Automatically connect to your previously launched wasmCloud lattice with a managed context or use contexts to administer remote wasmCloud lattices.

### drain

Manage contents of the local wasmCloud cache. wasmCloud manages a local cache that will avoid redundant fetching of content when possible. `drain` allows you to manually clear that cache to ensure you're always pulling the latest versions of actors and providers that are hosted in remote OCI registries.

### gen

Generate code from [smithy](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/index.html) files using [weld codegen](https://github.com/wasmCloud/weld/tree/main/codegen). This is the primary method of generating actor and capability provider code from .smithy interfaces. Currently has first class support for Rust actors and providers, along with autogenerated HTML documentation.

### keys

Generate ed25519 keys for securely signing and identifying wasmCloud entities (actors, providers, hosts). Read more about our decision to use ed25519 keys in our [ADR](https://wasmcloud.github.io/adr/0005-security-nkeys.html).

### lint

Perform lint checks on .smithy models, outputting warnings for best practices with interfaces.

### new

Create new wasmCloud projects from predefined [templates](https://github.com/wasmCloud/project-templates). This command is a one-stop-shop for creating new actors, providers, and interfaces for all aspects of your application.

### par

Create, modify and inspect [provider archives](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/provider-archive), a TAR format that contains a signed JWT and OS/Architecture specific binaries for native capability providers.

### reg

Push and Pull actors and capability providers to/from OCI compliant registries. Used extensively in our own CI/CD and in local development, where a local registry is used to store your development artifacts.

### up

Bootstrap a wasmCloud environment in one easy command, supporting both launching NATS and wasmCloud in the background as well as an "interactive" mode for shorter lived hosts.

### validate

Perform validation checks on .smithy models, ensuring that your interfaces are valid and usable for codegen and development.
