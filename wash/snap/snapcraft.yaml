  wash is a bundle of command line tools that, together, form a comprehensive CLI for wasmcloud development.
  Everything from generating signing keys to a fully interactive REPL environment is contained within the subcommands of wash.
  Our goal with wash is to encapsulate our tools into a single binary to make developing WebAssembly with wasmcloud painless and simple.
