# üíª Distributed computing, _simplified_

The wasmCloud runtime is a vessel for running applications in the cloud, at the edge, in the browser, on small devices, and anywhere else you can imagine.

**Move from concept to production without changing your design, architecture, or your programming environment.**

wasmCloud lets you focus on shipping _features_. Build secure, portable, re-usable components. Get rid of the headaches from being smothered by boilerplate, dependency hell, tight coupling, and designs mandated by your infrastructure.

## Core Tenets

- Dead simple distributed applications
- Run anywhere
- Secure by default
- Productivity for both developers and operations

# Getting Started

## Installation

Install the wasmCloud Shell (`wash`) with [one command](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation).

## Walkthrough

If you're new to the wasmCloud ecosystem, a great place to start is the [getting started](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/getting-started/) walkthrough.

## Quickstart

The following commands launch wasmCloud in a local development environment and deploy a simple "hello world" WebAssembly module.

```console
wash up -d
wash new actor -t hello hello
wash app deploy ./hello/wadm.yaml
curl localhost:8080
```

## Examples

### WebAssembly Modules (Stable ABI)

wasmCloud has a wide range of [examples](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/) built on the [stable ABI](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/hosts/abis/wasmbus/). This includes components, providers, interfaces, and full applications we've created to demonstrate how to design, compose, and build applications in wasmCloud.

### **Experimental** WASI Preview 2 WebAssembly Components

wasmCloud is actively staying up-to-date with WASI Preview 2 and the Component Model. For components which consume interfaces defined in [WIT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md), see examples in the [`examples` directory of this repository](./examples).

### üí• Awesome wasmCloud

# üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap and Vision

We have plenty of ideas and things going on in the wasmCloud project. Please check out the [Roadmap doc](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/roadmap) for more information, and the [wasmCloud Roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/3) to see the status of new features.

## Releases

The latest release and changelog can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/releases).

## üåá Community Resources

### Community Meetings

We host weekly community meetings at 1pm EST on Wednesdays. These community meetings are livestreamed to our Twitter account and to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@wasmCloud/streams). You can find the agenda and notes for each meeting in the [community](https://wasmcloud.com/community) secton of our webste. If you're interested in joining in on the call to demo or take part in the discussion, we have a Zoom link on our [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_6cm5hud8evuns4pe5ggu3h9qrs@group.calendar.google.com).

### Slack

We host our own [community slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com) for all community members to join and talk about WebAssembly, wasmCloud, or just general cloud native technology. For those of you who are already on the [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/), we also have our own channel at [#wasmcloud](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C027YTXEYFL).

---

## üìö Reference Documentation

wasmCloud uses some terminology you might not be familiar with. Check out the [concepts](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/concepts/interface-driven-development) section of our docs for a deeper dive.

---

## RPC Framework

wasmCloud uses an [RPC API](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/hosts/lattice-protocols/rpc) to enable seamless communication among the host runtime, components, and providers.

---

## Declarative Deployments

The **w**asmCloud **A**pplication **D**eployment **M**anager [wadm](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm) uses the Open Application Model to define and deploy application specifications.

---

## Host Runtimes

### ü¶Ä Rust Runtime

wasmCloud's [standard runtime](./crates/runtime) is built in Rust for its zero-cost abstractions, safety, security, and WebAssembly support.

### üï∏ JavaScript Runtime (`Experimental`)

For running a wasmCloud host in a browser or embedding in a JavaScript V8 host, use the [JavaScript Runtime](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-js)

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Elixir/OTP Runtime (`Deprecated`)

**Note**: The OTP Runtime is now **deprecated**.

~~The [Elixir/OTP](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp) runtime leverages Elixir/OTP for its battle-tested, massively-scalable foundation. It also leverages a Rust library.~~

---

## SDKs and libraries

### Rust Provider SDK

wasmCloud provides an [SDK](./crates/provider-sdk) for building capability providers in Rust.

### Go Provider SDK (`Experimental`)

wasmCloud also has an [**experimental** SDK](https://github.com/wasmCloud/provider-sdk-go) for building capability providers in Go.

### Provider Bindgen from WIT Interfaces (`Experimental`)

[`wasmcloud-provider-wit-bindgen`](./crates/provider-wit-bindgen) is a Rust macro used to generate code for [capability providers](./crates/providers).

### Provider Archive

[`provider-archive`](./crates/provider-archive) is a crate used to create Provider Archive (PAR) files. PARs are used to store, retrieve, and sign capability providers. Today, capability providers are distributed as binary files and run as system processes. In the future, wasmCloud aims to build capability providers as WebAssembly Components, which will remove the need for Provider Archives.

### `wasmcloud_actor` (`Experimental`)

[`wasmcloud_actor`](./crates/actor) is a wasmCloud actor library written in Rust which facilitates building of wasmCloud components.

The API of the crate matches closely what [`wit-bindgen`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) would generate, meaning that one can switch from using plain `wit-bindgen`-generated bindings to `wasmcloud_actor` (and back) with minimal or no code changes.

### wascap

[`wascap`](./crates/wascap) is a low-level library used to insert and retrieve [claims](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/hosts/security#claims) on components and providers. Claims are part of wasmCloud's zero-trust security model.
