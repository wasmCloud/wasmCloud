wasmCloud lets you focus on shipping _features_. Build secure, portable, re-usable components called **_actors_** and get rid of the headaches that come from being smothered by boilerplate, dependency hell, tight coupling, and making design decisions mandated by your infrastructure.

# üíª Distributed computing, _simplified_

The wasmCloud runtime is a vessel for running actors and capability providers in the cloud, at the edge, in the browser, on small devices, and anywhere else you can imagine.

If you're new to the wasmCloud ecosystem, a great place to start is the [getting started](https://wasmcloud.dev/overview/getting-started/) section of our [documentation](https://wasmcloud.dev).

You can also take a look at a wide range of [examples](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/) including our [Petclinic microservices demonstration](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/tree/main/petclinic) we've created to help illustrate a new way of designing, composing, and building applications.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Elixir/OTP Runtime 

The main Cloud Native wasmCloud host runtime is the [Elixir/OTP](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp) runtime. wasmCloud leverages Elixir/OTP for its battle tested, massively scalable foundation; we leverage Rust for its zero-cost abstractions, safety, security, and WebAssembly support.

## üï∏ JavaScript Runtime

For running a wasmCloud host in a browser or embedding in a JavaScript V8 host, use the [JavaScript Runtime](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-js).

### ü¶ÄÔ∏è Rust Runtime - Archived

The pure-Rust wasmCloud host runtime has been archived in favor of the new Elixir/OTP runtime. If you're looking for tooling to support running resources with the pure-Rust wasmCloud host, please refer to the [archived resources](./.archived/RESOURCES.md) file for compatible versions.
