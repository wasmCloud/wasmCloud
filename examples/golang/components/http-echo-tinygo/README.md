This repository contains a [Web Assembly System Interface ("WASI")][wasi] and [Component Model][component-model] enabled WebAssembly component example of a [Golang][go] (in this case [TinyGo][tinygo]), built to run on [wasmCloud][wasmcloud].

> **Warning**
> The WASI & the Component Model specifications are still undergoing changes and iterating quickly,
> so support inside wasmCloud is functional, but experimental.
>
> You may see the mention of things like "preview2" or "preview3" -- these represent phases
> of the in-progress specification, standardization, and implementation efforts which could cause
> breaking changes.

# Quickstart

## Install dependencies

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed:

- The [TinyGo toolchain][tinygo-toolchain]
- [`wash`, the WebAssembly SHell][wash] installed.

## Build the WASI actor

Once you have these two things, build the project locally:

```console
wash build
```

After the project, you'll have a couple new folders, most importantly the `build` folder:

```
build
â”œâ”€â”€ http-echo-tinygo-component_s.wasm
â””â”€â”€ http-echo-tinygo-component.wasm
```

`build/http-echo-tinygo-component_s.wasm` is the WebAssembly module, signed with it's required capabilities, and ready to run on a wasmCloud lattice.

## Start wasmCloud

Start wasmCloud, in a separate terminal:

```console
wash up --nats-websocket-port 4001
```

> **Warning**
> This demo works with [`wasmCloud` host versions 0.81.0 *or newer*][host-v0.81.0].

Optionally, you can also start the UI by running (in a separate terminal):

```console
wash ui --experimental
```

[host-v0.81.0]: https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/releases/tag/v0.81.0

## Deploy this application

We can deploy the local project using the wasmCloud declarative deployment engine, [`wadm`][wadm].

First, edit `wadm.yaml` to include the absolute path to the signed WebAssembly module:

```diff
# ....
  components:
    - name: http-echo-tinygo
      type: actor
      properties:
-        # TODO: you must replace the path below to match your genreated code in build
-       image: file:///absolute/path/to/this/repo/build/http-echo-tinygo_s.wasm
+       image: file:///the/absolute/path/to/build/http-echo-tinygo-component_s.wasm
      traits:
# ...
```

Then, deploy using `wash`:

```console
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

You can use `wash app` subcommand to do much more -- checking the list of applications, delete applications, and more.

For example, if you'd like to remove the previously deployed version of this project:

```console
wash app delete http-echo-tinygo-component v0.0.1
```

# Development

## Running tests

To run tests for this example:

```console
cd tests
go test -tags e2e
```

> **Information**
> Note that the tests use `go`, _not_ `tinygo`, and require `wash` to be installed
