#
# This project is an actor component example written in TinyGo,
# which returns details for all HTTP requests sent to it.
# 
# This actor leverages the WebAssembly Component Model[0], along with
# WebAssembly Interface Types[1] ("WIT") bindings to generate the 
# higher level interface definitions that the WebAssembly uses.
#
# As of 2023, components are cutting edge WebAssembly, and are thus experimental
# features in wasmCloud. 
#
# That said, this example *should* compile and run on wasmCloud:
#
# 1. Build the project with `wash build`
# 2. Deploy the project with `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` 
#
# Please file an issue if you encounter any friction (https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/issues/new)
