	// This function is invoked with an incoming HTTP Request, and a resource
	// `response-outparam` which provides the capability to reply with an HTTP
	// Response. The response is sent by calling the `response-outparam.set`
	// method, which allows execution to continue after the response has been
	// sent. This enables both streaming to the response body, and performing other
	// work.
	//
	// The implementor of this function must write a response to the
	// `response-outparam` before returning, or else the caller will respond
	// with an error on its behalf.
