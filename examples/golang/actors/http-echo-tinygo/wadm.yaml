# This is a full example of how to run the kvcounter actor exposed with an HTTP server.
#
# Using this example requires you to have a Redis server running locally
#  (though the linkdef can be modified to use a Redis server you have running elsewhere).
#
# You also need to have WADM running:
# https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/tree/main/wadm.
#
# You can deploy this example with a simple command:
# `wash app deploy wadm.yaml`
