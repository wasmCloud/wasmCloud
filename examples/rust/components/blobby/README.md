# Blobby

This component (we like to call it "Little Blobby Tables") is a simple file server showing the basic
CRUD operations of the `wasi:blobstore` contract.

Not only is this actor an example, it is also a fully-functional, HTTP-based fileserver that can be
fronted with any HTTP server implementation and any blobstore implementation (i.e. you could store
the uploaded files on a filesystem or in an s3 compatible store).

## Prerequisites

- `cargo` 1.75
- [`wash`](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) 0.26.0

## Building

```bash
wash build
```

## Running with wasmCloud

Ensuring you've built your component with `wash build`, you can launch wasmCloud and deploy the full hello world application with the following commands. Once the application reports as **Deployed** in the application list, you can use `curl` to send a request to the running HTTP server.

```shell
wash up -d
wash app deploy ./wadm.yaml
wash app list
curl http://localhost:8080
```

## Required Capabilities

1. `wasi:http` to receive http requests
2. `wasi:blobstore` to save the image to a blob
3. `wasi:logging` so the actor can log

Once everything is up and running, you can run through all of the operations by following the
annotated commands below:

```console
# Create a file with some content
$ echo 'Hello there!' > myfile.txt

# Upload the file to the fileserver
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -v 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/myfile.txt' --data-binary @myfile.txt
