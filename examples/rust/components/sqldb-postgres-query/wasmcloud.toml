#
# Normally, `wash dev` is able to automatically create required dependencies
# for your application, but it cannot yet spawn a postgres instances to serve
# the `wasmcloud:postgres` WIT interface.
#
# To make this project work with *local* usage of `wash dev`:
#
# 1. Start Postgres (ex. in a container, with `pg_ctl`, see README.md)
# 2. Ensure the `default-postgres` configuration is properly set up (see README.md)
#   - NOTE: In production, use wasmCloud secrets (not config) for the provider
# 3. Run `wash dev`
#
# The configuration below instructs `wash dev` to use the local manifest (rather than generating one)
# which will have configuration that is easy to modify/tweak to connect to your local postgres instance
#
