#
# This component implements the wasmcloud:wadm/handler interface to receive status updates
# from the WADM provider. The provider needs to be configured with the appropriate
# NATS connection details and application name to subscribe to.
#
# To make this project work with *local* usage of `wash dev`:
#
# 1. Ensure NATS is running and accessible
# 2. Configure the WADM provider with appropriate connection details
# 3. Set the application name you want to receive status updates for
# 4. Run `wash dev`
#
# The configuration below instructs `wash dev` to use the local manifest
# which contains the necessary WADM provider configuration and links
#
