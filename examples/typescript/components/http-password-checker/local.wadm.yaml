  components:
    # (Component) A test component that returns a string for any given HTTP request
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: file://./build/http_password_checker_s.wasm
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the component
        - type: spreadscaler

    # Add a capability provider that enables HTTP access
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.23.1
      traits:
        # Link the httpserver to the component, and configure the HTTP server
        # to listen on port 8080 for incoming requests
        #
        # Since this HTTP server provider calls the `http-component` component, we establish
        # a unidirectional link from this `httpserver` provider (the "source")
        # to the `http-component` component (the "target"), so the server can invoke
        # the component to handle a request.
