    # (Component) A test component that returns a string for any given HTTP request
    - name: http-component
      type: component

        # to listen on port 8000 for incoming requests
        #
        # Since this HTTP server provider calls the `http-component` component, we establish
        # a unidirectional link from this `httpserver` provider (the "source")
        # to the `http-component` component (the "target"), so the server can invoke
        # the component to handle a request.
