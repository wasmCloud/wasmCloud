# Typescript HTTP Hello World

This repository contains a hello world HTTP component, written in [Typescript][ts].

This component:

- Uses [Typescript][ts] for it's implementation
- Uses the [`wasi:http`][wasi-http] standard WIT definitions
- Relies on the [`httpserver` capability provider][httpserver-provider] (which exposes the [`wasmcloud:httpserver` interface][httpserver-interface])
- Returns `"hello from Typescript"` to all HTTP requests
- Can be declaratively provisioned with [`wadm`][wadm]

# Quickstart

To get started developing this repository quickly, clone the repo and run `wash dev`:

```console
wash dev
```

`wash dev` does many things for you:

- Starts the [wasmCloud host][wasmcloud-host] that can run your WebAssembly component
- Builds this project (including necessary `npm` script targets)
- Builds a declarative WADM manifest consisting of:
  - Your locally built component
  - A [HTTP server provider][httpserver-provider] which will receive requests from the outside world (on port 8000 by default)
  - Necessary links between providers and your component so your component can handle web traffic
- Deploys the built manifest (i.e all dependencies to run this application) locally
- Watches your code for changes and re-deploys when necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> To do things more manually, see [`docs/slow-start.md`](./docs/slow-start.md).

## Send a request to the running component

Once `wash dev` is serving your component, to send a request to the running component (via the HTTP server provider):

```console
curl localhost:8080
```

## Adding Capabilities

To learn how to extend this example with additional capabilities, see the [Adding Capabilities](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/adding-capabilities?lang=typescript) section of the wasmCloud documentation.
