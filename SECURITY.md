## Report A Vulnerability

Weâ€™re extremely grateful for security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to the
wasmCloud community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of wasmCloud maintainers.

To make a report please email the private security list at security@wasmcloud.com with the details.

The list of people on the security list is below: 

| Name            | GitHub Handle    |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Kevin Hoffman   | @autodidaddict   |
| Brooks Townsend | @brooksmtownsend |
| Taylor Thomas   | @thomastaylor312 |
| Liam Randall    | @LiamRandall     |

<!-- TODO: In the future, we may want to offer the possibility of encrypting the email using one of our GPG keys -->

### When To Send A Report

You think you have found a vulnerability in a wasmCloud project or a dependency of a wasmCloud
project. This can be any of the repositories on the [wasmCloud GitHub
organization](https://github.com/wasmCloud).

### When Not To Send A Report

* If a vulnerability has been found in an application deployed to a wasmCloud host
* For guidance on securing wasmCloud, please see the [documentation](https://wasmcloud.dev) or ask
  in one of the [Slack channels](https://slack.wasmcloud.com/)
* You are looking for help applying security updates

### Security Vulnerability Response

Each report will be reviewed and receipt acknowledged within 3 business days. This will set off the
security review process detailed below.

Any vulnerability information shared with the security team stays within the wasmCloud project and
will not be shared with others unless it is necessary to fix the issue. Information is shared only
on a need to know basis.

We ask that vulnerability reporter(s) act in good faith by not disclosing the issue to others. And
we strive to act in good faith by acting swiftly, and by justly crediting the vulnerability
reporter(s) in writing.

As the security issue moves through triage, identification, and release the reporter of the security
vulnerability will be notified. Additional questions about the vulnerability may also be asked of
the reporter.

### Public Disclosure

A public disclosure of security vulnerabilities is released alongside release updates or details
that fix the vulnerability. We try to fully disclose vulnerabilities once a mitigation strategy is
available. Our goal is to perform a release and public disclosure quickly and in a timetable that
works well for users. For example, a release may be ready on a Friday but for the sake of users may
be delayed to a Monday.

CVEs will be assigned to vulnerabilities. Due to the process and time it takes to obtain a CVE ID,
disclosures may happen first. In this case, once the ID has been assigned the disclosure will be
updated.

If the vulnerability reporter would like their name and details shared as part of the disclosure
process we are happy to. We will ask permission and for the way the reporter would like to be
identified. We appreciate vulnerability reports and would like to credit reporters if they would
like the credit.

## Security Team Membership

The security team is made up of a subset of the wasmCloud project maintainers who are willing and
able to respond to vulnerability reports.

### Responsibilities

* Members MUST be active project maintainers on active (non-deprecated) wasmCloud projects.
* Members SHOULD engage in each reported vulnerability, at a minimum to make sure it is being
  handled
* Members MUST keep the vulnerability details private and only share on a need to know basis

### Membership

New members are required to be active maintainers of wasmCloud projects who are willing to perform
the responsibilities outlined above. The security team is a subset of the maintainers. Members can
step down at any time and may join at any time.

From time to time, wasmCloud projects are deprecated. If at any time a security team member is found
to be no longer be an active maintainer on active wasmCloud projects, this individual will be
removed from the security team.

## Patch and Release Team

When a vulnerability comes in and is acknowledged, a team - including maintainers of the wasmCloud
project affected - will assembled to patch the vulnerability, release an update, and publish the
vulnerability disclosure. This may expand beyond the security team as needed but will stay within
the pool of wasmCloud project maintainers.

## Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures are published as security advisories in the relevant project repos. The
disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability, a fix for the vulnerability
that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

Disclosures will be published on the same day as a release fixing the vulnerability after the
release is published and the release notes will contain a link to the published advisory.
