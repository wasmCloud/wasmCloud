            :warning: It looks like your commit is not formatted in line with [Conventional Commits][cc]

            </h3>

            The [wasmCloud][wasmcloud] project uses Conventional Commits to enable automation and ensure consistent commit messages across the project.

            If you're feeling adventurous, amend/interactively rebase your commits to match the conventional commit standard.

            For example, if you added a feature to the wasmCloud host:

            ```console
            git amend -m "feat(host): your awesome new feature title here"
            ```

            If you don't feel comfortable doing this, don't worry -- a project maintainer will help correct this for you, before merging.
