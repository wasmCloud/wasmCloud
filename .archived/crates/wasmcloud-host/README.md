# ⚠️ Archived
This crate, the Rust runtime for wasmCloud host, has been archived in favor of the newer [OTP Runtime](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp). The Rust runtime has been preserved to help people use as a reference as they transition from 0.18 to 0.50, but these files will eventually be removed.

# wasmCloud Host

[wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com) is a secure, distributed actor platform with an autonomous mesh network built
for bridging disparate and far-flung infrastructure.
