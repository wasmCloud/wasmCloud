	/// Resolve an internet host name to a list of IP addresses.
	/// 
	/// See the wasi-socket proposal README.md for a comparison with getaddrinfo.
	/// 
	/// # Parameters
	/// - `name`: The name to look up. IP addresses are not allowed. Unicode domain names are automatically converted
	///     to ASCII using IDNA encoding.
	/// - `address-family`: If provided, limit the results to addresses of this specific address family.
	/// - `include-unavailable`: When set to true, this function will also return addresses of which the runtime
	///   thinks (or knows) can't be connected to at the moment. For example, this will return IPv6 addresses on
	///   systems without an active IPv6 interface. Notes:
	///     - Even when no public IPv6 interfaces are present or active, names like "localhost" can still resolve to an IPv6 address.
	///     - Whatever is "available" or "unavailable" is volatile and can change everytime a network cable is unplugged.
	/// 
	/// This function never blocks. It either immediately fails or immediately returns successfully with a `resolve-address-stream`
	/// that can be used to (asynchronously) fetch the results.
	/// 
	/// At the moment, the stream never completes successfully with 0 items. Ie. the first call
	/// to `resolve-next-address` never returns `ok(none)`. This may change in the future.
	/// 
	/// # Typical errors
	/// - `invalid-name`:                 `name` is a syntactically invalid domain name.
	/// - `invalid-name`:                 `name` is an IP address.
	/// - `address-family-not-supported`: The specified `address-family` is not supported. (EAI_FAMILY)

    type resolve-address-stream = u32

	/// Returns the next address from the resolver.
	/// 
	/// This function should be called multiple times. On each call, it will
	/// return the next address in connection order preference. If all
	/// addresses have been exhausted, this function returns `none`.
	/// After which, you should release the stream with `drop-resolve-address-stream`.
	/// 
	/// This function never returns IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
	/// 
	/// # Typical errors
	/// - `name-unresolvable`:          Name does not exist or has no suitable associated IP addresses. (EAI_NONAME, EAI_NODATA, EAI_ADDRFAMILY)
	/// - `temporary-resolver-failure`: A temporary failure in name resolution occurred. (EAI_AGAIN)
	/// - `permanent-resolver-failure`: A permanent failure in name resolution occurred. (EAI_FAIL)
	/// - `would-block`:                A result is not available yet. (EWOULDBLOCK, EAGAIN)
	resolve-next-address: func(this: resolve-address-stream) -> result<option<ip-address>, error-code>

	/// Dispose of the specified `resolve-address-stream`, after which it may no longer be used.
	/// 
	/// Note: this function is scheduled to be removed when Resources are natively supported in Wit.
	drop-resolve-address-stream: func(this: resolve-address-stream)

	/// Create a `pollable` which will resolve once the stream is ready for I/O.
	/// 
	/// Note: this function is here for WASI Preview2 only.
	/// It's planned to be removed when `future` is natively supported in Preview3.
