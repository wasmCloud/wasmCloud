## docker-compose

Bundles [NATS](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats/), [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) and [Registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry) into a single manifest. These components are commonly used during wasmcloud development and when running our example components and providers, so it's beneficial to use this compose file when starting your wasmcloud journey.
