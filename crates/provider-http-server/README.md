# wasmCloud HTTP Server Provider

This capability provider imports the `wasi:http/incoming-handler` interface and enables a component to accept incoming HTTP(s) requests. It is implemented in Rust with the [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/) web server framework and the fast and scalable [hyper](https://docs.rs/hyper/) HTTP implementation.

## Building

This HTTP server can be built from the root of this repository with `wash build`.

```shell
wash build -p src/bin/http-server-provider
```

## Provider Configuration

The wasmCloud HTTP server has optional configuration that you can provide to it at startup. All configuration keys are case insensitive, as in two configuration values "ROUTING_MODE" and "routing_mode" will conflict, so ensure they are unique. See the [provider config](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/developer/providers/configure) documentation for information about defining and using this configuration. All link configuration should be passed as `source` configuration, with the HTTP server as the source.

The configuration passed to this provider at startup primarily defines the "mode" the HTTP server should be running in. The `address` mode sets up a listener on a provided address for **each** linked component, and the `path` mode sets up a listener on a provided address, using the `path` link configuration to route to the linked component.

| Key               | Value                  | Default        | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `routing_mode`    | "address"              | `address`      | Dictates the routing mode of the capability provider. `address` mode will listen on a new address for each component. |
| `default_address` | A valid listen address | "0.0.0.0:8000" | The default listen address to listen on and route to components.                                                      |

Configuration differs slightly depending on the `routing_mode` chosen for the HTTP server.

### Address routing mode

In address routing mode, the above configuration of `routing_mode` and `default_address` is supplied as provider configuration. Each [link](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/concepts/linking-components/linking-at-runtime/) from the HTTP server to a component can be configured using the [HTTP address configuration](#http-address-configuration) below. Since the `default_address` can only be used once, the `address` field is a **required** configuration value for any deployments serving more than one component.

### Path routing mode

In path routing mode, the above configuration of `routing_mode` and `default_address` is supplied as provider configuration as well as all values in [HTTP address configuration](#http-address-configuration). The HTTP server, when in path routing mode, sets up a listener at startup to serve **all** components.

All components must be configured with a `path` on the link config for routing in this mode.

| Key    | Default | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path` | `N/A`   | **Required.** The path, e.g. `/api/v1`, to register to send all requests at that path to the linked component. |

This is an example of a manifest that routes to two different components in path mode, listening on `0.0.0.0:8081` and serving paths `/foo` and `/bar`.
