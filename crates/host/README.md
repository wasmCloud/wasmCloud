# ðŸ’» Distributed computing, _simplified_

The wasmCloud runtime is a vessel for running applications in the cloud, at the edge, in the browser, on small devices, and anywhere else you can imagine.

**Move from concept to production without changing your design, architecture, or your programming environment.**

wasmCloud lets you focus on shipping _features_. Build secure, portable, re-usable components. Get rid of the headaches from being smothered by boilerplate, dependency hell, tight coupling, and designs mandated by your infrastructure.

## Core Tenets

- Dead simple distributed applications
- Run anywhere
- Secure by default
- Productivity for both developers and operations

# wasmCloud Host Runtime

This crate contains the host runtime itself. Check out the [top-level project](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud) for information about the wasmCloud ecosystem as a whole.
