# wasmCloud Host

wasmCloud is an open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project that enables teams to build, manage, and scale polyglot Wasm apps across any cloud, K8s, or edge.

⚠️ This crate is highly experimental and likely to experience breaking changes frequently. The host itself is relatively stable, but the APIs and public members of this crate are not guaranteed to be stable.

## Usage

This crate can be used to embed a wasmCloud host in a Rust application. You can refer to the [main.rs](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/src/main.rs) file of the wasmCloud runtime for an example of this.
