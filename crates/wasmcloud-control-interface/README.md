# wasmCloud Control Interface
This library is a convenient API for interacting with the lattice control interface.

The lattice control interface provides a way for clients to interact with the lattice to issue control commands and queries. This interface is a message broker protocol that supports functionality like starting and stopping actors and providers, declaring link definitions, monitoring lattice events, holding auctions to determine scheduling compatibility, and much more.
