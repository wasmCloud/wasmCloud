The k6 benchmark should now be running! To get the logs and output of the test, you can run:

kubectl logs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l k6_cr={{ include "benchmark.fullname" . }}-test,runner=true --tail=-1
{{- end }}

If you'd like to view dashboards during or after your tests, port-forward to the Grafana instance:

kubectl port-forward -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-grafana 3000:80

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and navigate to the "Test Environment" dashboard in the dashboards section.
