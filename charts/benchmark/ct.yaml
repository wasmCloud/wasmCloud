# If we don't set an existing namespace, things just...fail. With nothing set it gets an error that
# the namespace cannot be imported into the current release (this also happens when you do `kubectl

# We are only testing that everything installs and the k6 tests start. The k6 tests will just get
# errors because the endpoint doesn't exist, which is fine for making sure everything deploys. We
# can come back and do a full app deploy with wasmCloud and check results later.
