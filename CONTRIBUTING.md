# Contributing Guide

THIS GUIDE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This document describes the requirements for committing to the wasmCloud project.

## Pull Request Management

All code that is contributed to wasmCloud must go through the Pull Request (PR) process. To
contribute a PR, fork this project, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, and then use
GitHub to open a pull request with your changes.

Every PR must be reviewed by at least one Core Maintainer of the project. Once a PR has been marked
"Approved" by a Core Maintainer (and no other core maintainer has an open "Rejected" vote), the PR
may be merged. While it is fine for non-maintainers to contribute their own code reviews, those
reviews do not satisfy the above requirement.

## Signoffs

All code in this and every other repository must satisfy the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) signoff rules. To achieve this, just use the `-s` flag in your git commit. This is a requirement of the wasmCloud project being a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
