# Contributing Guide

This document describes the requirements for committing to this repository.


## Pull Request Management

All code that is contributed to waSCCd must go through the Pull Request (PR) process. To
contribute a PR, fork this project, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, and then use
GitHub to open a pull request with your changes.

Every PR must be reviewed by at least one Core Maintainer of the project. Once a PR has been marked
"Approved" by a Core Maintainer (and no other core maintainer has an open "Rejected" vote), the PR
may be merged. While it is fine for non-maintainers to contribute their own code reviews, those
reviews do not satisfy the above requirement.
