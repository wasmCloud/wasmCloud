A contribution ladder is a document that defines the "ladder to climb" to become a maintainer of one
or more wasmCloud projects. You will need to gain people's trust, demonstrate your competence and
understanding, and meet the requirements of the role.

## Community Member

Everyone is a community member! :tada: You've read this far so you are already ahead.

Here are some ideas for how you can be more involved and participate in the community:

* Comment on an issue that you’re interested in.
* Submit a pull request to fix an issue.
* Report a bug.
* Share a component/provider you made and your experience with it
* Come chat with us in [Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com/).

As a community member you must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributor

You can be a contributor to multiple wasmCloud repositories. This role will be assigned basic
privileges on the wasmCloud respositories where they are contributors. Contributors have the
following capabilities:

* Have issues and pull requests assigned to them
* Apply labels, milestones and projects
* [Mark issues as
  duplicates](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests)
* Close, reopen, and assign issues and pull requests

They must agree to and follow our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### How to become a contributor

To become a contributor, the maintainers of the project would like to see you:

* Comment on issues with your experiences and opinions.
* Add your comments and reviews on pull requests.
* Contribute pull requests.
* Open issues with bugs, experience reports, and questions.

Contributors and maintainers will do their best to watch for community members who may make good
contributors. But don’t be shy, if you feel that this is you, please reach out to one or more of the
contributors or maintainers.

## Project Maintainer

Project Maintainers are members who are maintainers of specific wasmCloud projects with extra
capabilities:

* Be a Code Owner and have reviews automatically requested.
* Review pull requests.
* Merge pull requests.

Maintainers also have additional responsibilities beyond just merging code:

* Help foster a safe and welcoming environment for all project participants. This will include
  understanding and enforcing our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Organize and promote pull request reviews, e.g. prompting community members, contributors, and
  other maintainers to review.
* Triage issues, e.g. adding labels, promoting discussions, finalizing decisions.
* Help organize our weekly meetings, e.g. schedule, organize and execute agenda.
* Make project-level technical decisions in conjunction with other maintainers

They must agree to and follow the [Reviewing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#reviewing) found in our
Contributing Guide.

### How to become a maintainer

To become a maintainer, we would like you to see you be an effective contributor, and show that you
can do some of the things maintainers do. Maintainers will do their best to regularly discuss
promoting contributors. But don’t be shy, if you feel that this is you, please reach out to one or
more of the maintainers.

### Other types of maintainers

We know that not all people want to manage code in a project! To that end, we also recognize that
some maintainers/contributors may also want to take on a "community management" role. A community
managment maintainer will have other types of responsibilities:

* Managing Slack and other communication channels
* Planning community meetups/events
* Coordinating additional developer meetings
* Managing/reviewing blog posts
* Assisting, as desired, with branding/messaging/CNCF communicating

## Org Maintainers

Org maintainers are maintainers with extra [responsibilities](https://youtu.be/b23wrRfy7SM):

* Help manage org level permissions and access
* Serve as a tiebreaker in the case of any ties among other wasmCloud projects
* In most cases, should be involved as a project maintainer for at least one of the wasmCloud
  projects
* Decide with other org maintainers on the overall direction of wasmCloud 

### How to become an org maintainer

It isn't expected that all maintainers will need or want to move up to org maintainer. If you are a
maintainer, and find yourself often asking an admin to do certain tasks for you and you would like
to help out with administrative tasks or decisions, please reach out to one or more of the org
maintainers.

## Emeritus Maintainers

Any maintainer (org or project) who withdraws from active maintainership will be designated an
Emeritus Maintainer as a thank you for their contributions. They have no responsibilities but remain
permanently "on the record" as former maintainers unless they request to be removed.
